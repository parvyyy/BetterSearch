The Rough Plan:
    - Have data stored in several .txt files
    - The program should read the files and create an object to store the information
        - Try to have it broken up into sections (i.e. each object only contains 20 lines)
    
    - The user should be then prompted to request a word or phrase.
    - The program will search for the phrase, its individual words AND related / similar words and display the obj's containing them
        - It should be ordered based on 'relevancy'. 
    - If a word like "space is" is searched, the "is" should not be considered when the program finds similar words / individual words

    - Asks continuously until the user presses Cntrl. C.

    - Can later expand this to maybe be searchable by dates, or similar categories.
